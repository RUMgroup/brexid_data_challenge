#Silhouette plot
#Recall that the silhouette coefficient (Si) measures how similar an object i is to the the other objects in its own cluster versus those in the neighbor cluster. Si values range from 1 to - 1:

#  A value of Si close to 1 indicates that the object is well clustered. In the other words, the object i is similar to the other objects in its group.
#A value of Si close to -1 indicates that the object is poorly clustered, and that assignment to some other cluster would probably improve the overall results.
#Itâ€™s possible to draw silhouette coefficients of observations using the function fviz_silhouette() [factoextra package], which will also print a summary of the silhouette analysis output. To avoid this, you can use the option print.summary = FALSE.
